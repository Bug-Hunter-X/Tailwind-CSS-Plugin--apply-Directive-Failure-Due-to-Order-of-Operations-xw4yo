The solution involves ensuring that the plugin loads after the core Tailwind styles. This may involve adjusting the plugin's configuration or the Tailwind configuration itself.  Alternatively, the styles referenced in `@apply` can be explicitly defined within the plugin or they can be moved to a different part of the CSS that is always loaded before the plugin.

```javascript
// bugSolution.js
module.exports = function ({ addUtilities, theme }) {
  addUtilities({
    '.my-custom-style': {
      backgroundColor: theme('colors.blue.500'),
      color: theme('colors.white'),
      padding: theme('spacing.4')
    }
  })
}
```

This revised approach avoids the `@apply` directive, ensuring style application is independent of compile order. Using theme() method to access Tailwind's theme values ensures proper integration within Tailwind's build process.
